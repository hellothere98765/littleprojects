Video Projects I've Made

ASCIIVid is a script that takes a video and converts every frame into text art, then returns it back to you. 
VideoComp simulates effects of video compression on a random video.
ParticleSimulator is a Lennard Jones Particle Simulator with periodic boundary conditions or defined edges which will run for however long you want it to. It will save every frame as an image and then compile them.
